*
* The PDL Cryptolite driver provides a public API to perform hardware accelerated cryptographic calculations. 
*
* The functions and other declarations used in this driver are in cy_cryptolite.h.
* You can also include cy_pdl.h to get access to all functions and declarations in the PDL.
*
* The Cryptolite driver supports AES (128bits), SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256, TRNG, RSA and ECDSA.
*
* \section group_cryptolite_configuration_considerations Configuration Considerations
*
* User can enable/disable cryptographic functionality based on the project
* requirements. To do so, create a configuration header file to configure cryptographic
* functionalities and define a macro CY_CRYPTOLITE_USER_CONFIG_FILE with configuration
* header file name and add to project environment. If CY_CRYPTOLITE_USER_CONFIG_FILE macro
* is not defined in project environment, firmware will enable all available
* cryptographic functionalities.
*
*Firmware sets up a cryptographic operation by passing in the required data as parameters in the function calls.
*
* All Cryptolite function require a context. A context is a data
* structure that the driver uses for its operations. Firmware declares a
* context (allocates memory) but does not write or read the values in that
* context. In effect, the context is a scratch pad you provide to the driver.
* The driver uses the context to store and manipulate data during cryptographic
* operations. The Cryptolite driver header file declare all the required structures
* for context.
*
* Note: Cryptolite works only with SAHB mapped address, User must map any CBUS mapped
*       address to SAHB address before using the API.

*   <tr>
*     <td>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)</td>
*     <td>A cryptographic hash function.
*     This function takes a message of an arbitrary length and reduces it to a
*     fixed-length residue or message digest after performing a series of
*     mathematically defined operations that practically guarantee that any
*     change in the message will change the hash value. It is used for message
*     authentication by transmitting a message with a hash value appended to it
*     and recalculating the message hash value using the same algorithm at the
*     recipient's end. If the hashes differ, then the message is corrupted.
*     For more information see [Secure Hash standard description]

*     <td>Block Cipher</td>
*     <td>An encryption function for fixed-size blocks of data.
*     This function takes a fixed-size key and a block of plaintext data from
*     the message and encrypts it to generate ciphertext. Block ciphers are
*     reversible. The function performed on a block of encrypted data will
*     decrypt that data.</td>
*   </tr>
*
*   <tr>
*     <td>Block Cipher Mode</td>
*     <td>A mode of encrypting a message using block ciphers for messages of an
*     arbitrary length. The message is padded so that its length is an integer
*     multiple of the block size. ECB (Electronic Code Book), CBC (Cipher Block
*     Chaining), and CFB (Cipher Feedback) are all modes of using block ciphers
*     to create an encrypted message of an arbitrary length.
*     </td>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</td>
*     <td>The [AES standard] (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf)
*     specifies the Rijndael algorithm, a symmetric block
*     cipher that can process 128-bit data blocks, using cipher keys with
*     128-, 192-, and 256-bit lengths. Rijndael was designed to handle
*     additional block sizes and key lengths. However, they are not adopted in
*     this standard. AES is also used for message authentication.
*     </td>
*   </tr>
*   <tr>
*     <td>Message Authentication Code (MAC)</td>
*     <td>MACs are used to verify that a received message has not been altered.
*     This is done by first computing a MAC value at the sender's end and
*     appending it to the transmitted message. When the message is received,
*     the MAC is computed again and checked against the MAC value transmitted
*     with the message. If they do not match, the message has been altered.
*     Either a Hash algorithm (such as SHA) or a block cipher (such as AES) can
*     be used to produce the MAC value. Keyed MAC schemes use a Secret Key
*     along with the message, thus the Key value must be known to be able to
*     compute the MAC value.</td>

*
*   <tr>
*     <td>Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)</td>
*     <td>A specific type of message authentication code (MAC) that involves a
*     cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.
*     It computes the MAC value using a Hash algorithm.
*     For more information see [The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code standard]

*   <tr>
*     <td>Symmetric Key Cryptography</td>
*     <td>Uses a common, known key to encrypt and decrypt messages (a shared
*     secret between sender and receiver). An efficient method used for
*     encrypting and decrypting messages after the authenticity of the other
*     party has been established. AES is well-known symmetric cryptography methods.</td>
*   </tr>
*
*   <tr>
*     <td>Asymmetric Key Cryptography</td>
*     <td>Also referred to as Public Key encryption. To receive a message,
*     you publish a very large public key (up to 4096 bits currently). The
*     public key is described by the pair (n, e) where n is a product of
*     two randomly chosen primes p and q. The exponent e is a random integer
*     1 < e < Q where Q = (p-1) (q-1). The private key d is uniquely defined
*     by the integer 1 < d < Q so that ed congruent with 1 (mod Q ). To send
*     a message to the publisher of the public key, you encrypt the message
*     with the public key. This message can now be decrypted only with the
*     private key. The message is now sent over any channel to the recipient
*     who can decrypt it with the private (secret) key. The same process is
*     used to send messages to the sender of the original message. The
*     asymmetric cryptography relies on the mathematical impracticality
*     (usually related to the processing power available at any given time)
*     of factoring the keys.
